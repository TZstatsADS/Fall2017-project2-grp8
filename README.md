# Project 2: Open Data App - an RShiny app development project

### [Project Description](doc/project2_desc.md)

![screenshot](doc/screenshot2.png)

In this second project of GU4243/GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop an *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on a topic of your choice using U.S. government open data released on the [data.gov](https://data.gov/) website. See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The **learning goals** for this project is:

- business intelligence for data science
- data cleaning
- data visualization
- systems development/design life cycle
- shiny app/shiny server

+ **Project summary**: 
SD: It is very common to encounter delays when traveling by air. To guarantee the arrival time is not later than the proposed time limit, people can select their carriers according to our treemap plot. We can select the origin and destination airports, the proposed traveling month, and the proposed delay time limit from 0 to 5 hours. Then the Treemap will display the carriers of all the flights satisfying your requirements with the success probability. Here, the success probability is the probability that if you choose certain carrier for your travel from the chosen origin to the chosen destination in the chosen month, then how likely you can arrive at the destination no later than the chosen delay time limit. We believe this app can help you make a smarter choice of carriers.
