The purpose of this app is to aid customers in choosing a flight based on various crtieria, mostly relating to delay time expecations. We offer the following services given flight information (destination, origin, flight time, carrier):
* Dynamic Map of Flights 1990 vs 2010
* Search your flight: flight carrier suggestion based on desired flight (destination, origin, flight time)
	* Dynamic Map of potential flights given inputs
	* Carrier recommendation based on delay probability
* Statistics:
	* Delay Time Expectation:
		* Expected Flight Delay Time in Minutes: shows expected number of minutes you can expect a given flight to be delayed for a given carrier in a given month
		* Number of Delayed Flights: shows the number of delayed flights a given carrier had in each month (sense of scale)
		* Delay Time Distribution: shows distribution of delay time for a given flight by carrier
	* Delay Reason:
		* Delay Reason Distribution: shows distribution of delay reasons for a given flight and month by carrier
	* Satisfaction Probability of Carriers:
		* Tree map showing satisfaction probability for a given flight, month, and delay threshold by carrier (i.e. probability a given flight/month/carrier will arrive within your delay threshold)
